## Current Skills Inventory

**Instructions:** Rate each skill area honestly using evidence, not aspirations.

**Rating Scale:**
- **None:** Never used, would need to learn from scratch
- **Basic:** Aware, read documentation, haven't used in production
- **Intermediate:** Used in production, comfortable with common patterns
- **Advanced:** Deep expertise, can teach others, handle edge cases

| Skill Category | Specific Skill | Current Level | Evidence (how we know) |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Example entries:**
- Core Technology | React fundamentals | Advanced | 2+ years production apps
- Build Tools | Vite configuration | Intermediate | Use daily, basic plugins
- Patterns | Module Federation | None | Never used

## Required Skills for Option

**Architecture Option:** _______________________

**Instructions:** Enumerate ALL skills required. Include "hidden" skills like debugging, monitoring, deployment.

| Required Skill | Level Needed (Basic/Int/Adv) | Current Level | Gap? |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------------|------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Categories to consider:**
- Core technology (language, framework)
- Build & tooling (bundlers, compilers)
- Architecture patterns (distributed systems, event-driven, etc.)
- Infrastructure (deployment, CI/CD, orchestration)
- Debugging & troubleshooting
- Monitoring & observability

## Gap Analysis

**Total skills required:** _____

**Skills we have (at required level or higher):** _____

**Skills we lack (critical gaps):** _____

**Capability Match:** _____ / _____ = _____ %

**Gap Percentage:** 100% - (Capability Match %) = _____ %

**Interpretation:**
- <30% gap: **Low risk** - Team ready, minor learning needed
- 30-50% gap: **Moderate risk** - Manageable learning investment
- 50-70% gap: **High risk** - Extended learning or need external hiring
- >70% gap: **Critical risk** - Likely unachievable without major investment

## Learning Investment Estimation

### Time to Proficiency

**Skills with critical gaps:** (List top 5-10)
1. _______________________: Estimated learning time: _____ weeks
2. _______________________: Estimated learning time: _____ weeks
3. _______________________: Estimated learning time: _____ weeks
4. _______________________: Estimated learning time: _____ weeks
5. _______________________: Estimated learning time: _____ weeks

**Total learning time (longest critical path):** _____ weeks

**Add buffer for trial-and-error (1.5-2x):** _____ weeks

**Realistic time to proficiency:** _____ weeks

### Productivity Impact During Learning

**Productivity during learning phase:** _____ % of baseline

**Calculation:**
- Weeks to proficiency: _____
- Team size: _____ people
- Productivity loss: (100% - _____%) = _____% lost
- Person-weeks lost: _____ weeks × _____ people × _____% = _____ person-weeks

### Financial Cost

**Opportunity Cost Calculation:**
```
Person-weeks: _____
Hours per week: 40
Average hourly rate: $_____
Opportunity cost: _____ × 40 × $_____ = $_____
```

**External Training:**
- Training courses: $_____

## Learning Feasibility Assessment

**Is learning realistic given timeline?**
- [ ] Yes - We have _____ weeks available, need _____ weeks
- [ ] No - We have _____ weeks available, need _____ weeks (shortfall: _____)

**Is productivity loss acceptable?**
- [ ] Yes - Can absorb _____% capacity reduction for _____ weeks
- [ ] No - Business needs require maintaining current velocity

**Are team members willing/able to learn?**
- [ ] Yes - Team enthusiastic and capable
- [ ] Mixed - Some team members resistant or lack learning capacity
- [ ] No - Team at capacity, learning would cause burnout

**Learning Feasibility Score:** _____ % (0-100%, subjective assessment)

---

## Capability Fit Score

**Formula:** (Capability Match %) × (Learning Feasibility %) × (1 - Risk Level %)

**Inputs:**
- Capability Match: _____ %
- Learning Feasibility: _____ %
- Risk Level: _____ % (from risk assessment, or estimate 0-100%)

**Calculation:**
```
Fit Score = (_____ %) × (_____ %) × (100% - _____ %)
          = (_____ ) × (_____ ) × (_____ )
          = _____ %
```

**Interpretation:**
- >70%: **Good fit** - Team ready, low risk
- 50-70%: **Moderate fit** - Manageable with planning
- 30-50%: **Poor fit** - Excessive learning/risk
- <30%: **Unacceptable** - Do not pursue

---

## Risk Factors

**Knowledge Gaps Creating Risk:**
- [ ] Critical skill gaps (>50%) in core competencies
- [ ] No team member with relevant experience (no mentor available)
- [ ] Complex debugging requiring skills we lack
- [ ] Production support requiring unavailable expertise

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- External hiring? (Timeline: _____, Cost: $_____)
- Consulting engagement? (Duration: _____, Cost: $_____)
- Extended timeline for learning? (Acceptable? Y/N)
- Paired programming with experts? (Available? Y/N)

**After mitigation, is option viable?**
- [ ] Yes - Gaps closeable with acceptable investment
- [ ] No - Gaps too large even with mitigation

---

## Alternative: Simpler Option Assessment

**Is there a simpler option with better capability fit?**

**Alternative Option:** _______________________

**Capability Match (alternative):** _____ % (vs. _____ % for original option)

**Gap (alternative):** _____ % (vs. _____ % for original option)

**Learning Investment (alternative):** $_____ (vs. $_____ for original option)

**If alternative capability match >20% better, strongly consider it.**

---

## Decision

Based on capability assessment:

**This option is:**
- [ ] **Good fit** (>70% capability match, <30% gap, learning feasible)
- [ ] **Moderate fit** (50-70% match, manageable learning with investment)
- [ ] **Poor fit** (30-50% match, excessive learning burden)
- [ ] **Unacceptable** (<30% match, >70% gap, unrealistic to achieve)

**Proceed to financial analysis?**
- [ ] Yes - Capability acceptable, assess cost
- [ ] No - Gap too large, reconsider option

**Rationale:** _______________________

**Evidence/reasoning:** _______________________

**Examples:**
- Microfrontends: +30-50% (coordination, version management, integration testing)
- Kubernetes: +20-30% (YAML management, cluster maintenance, troubleshooting)
- Monolith optimization: +10-15% (bundle analysis, performance monitoring)

**Is ongoing overhead acceptable?**
- [ ] Yes - Business value justifies permanent tax
- [ ] No - Too expensive for sustained velocity
