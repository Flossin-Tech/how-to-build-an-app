# Phase 3: Development

Writing code that works, is secure, and others can maintain.

This is where the rubber meets the road. You're not just writing code that runs—you're writing code that other people (including future you) will need to understand, modify, and debug. Code that won't leak secrets, fall apart under load, or introduce security vulnerabilities.

Development is more than translating requirements into syntax. It's about making trade-offs between speed and safety, knowing when to refactor and when to ship, and building systems that your team can actually work with six months from now when the original context has faded.

The difference between code that works and code that lasts is attention to quality, security, and maintainability from the start. Technical debt is inevitable, but most of it comes from not thinking about the future at all—not from moving fast.

## Key Questions This Phase Answers

- How do we write code that's clear enough for others to understand and modify?
- How do we prevent security vulnerabilities from making it into production?
- What does a good code review look like, and how do we make it valuable instead of painful?
- How do we manage secrets and sensitive data without leaking them?
- When should we refactor, and when should we just ship what works?

## What Comes Next

Once you've written code that works and is maintainable, you need to verify it actually does what you think it does—and that it won't break or get compromised. That's what **[Testing](../04-testing/index.md)** is for.
