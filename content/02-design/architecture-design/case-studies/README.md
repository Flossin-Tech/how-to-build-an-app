# Architecture Decision Case Studies

Real-world architecture decisions analyzed with quantitative frameworks and honest trade-off assessment.

## What You'll Find Here

These case studies demonstrate **how to make architecture decisions using data and evidence** rather than trends or opinions. Each follows a structured methodology that you can apply to your own decisions.

### Available Case Studies

#### [Microfrontend vs. Monolith Decision](microfrontend-vs-monolith.md)

**Context:** Finance sector web app with <500 users and one small team considering microfrontends for three new feature areas.

**Decision:** Extended monolith with React.lazy code splitting

**Key Insight:** 10x below documented scale threshold, 68-78% skill gap, and $207K-$332K savings over 3 years made the choice clear.

**What Makes This Useful:**
- Quantitative framework for comparing architecture options
- Documented industry thresholds for when patterns make sense
- Financial modeling including opportunity costs
- Honest assessment of team capabilities
- Clear criteria for when to revisit the decision

**Reading Time:**
- Quick answer: 7 minutes (Abstract + Conclusion)
- Understanding the framework: 35-45 minutes (key sections)
- Full deep dive: 60-90 minutes (complete methodology)

## How Case Studies Are Structured

Each case study follows an academic research paper format:

1. **Abstract** - Complete summary of the decision (3 min read)
2. **Introduction** - Problem context and significance (5 min read)
3. **Literature Review** - Industry patterns and documented thresholds (10-15 min read)
4. **Methodology** - Step-by-step decision framework (10-15 min read)
5. **Results** - Quantitative analysis and scoring (15-20 min read)
6. **Discussion** - Trade-offs and applicability (10-15 min read)
7. **Conclusion** - Final recommendation and implementation approach (5-8 min read)
8. **References** - Citations to industry sources and research

## Reading Strategies

### Just Need the Answer?
**Read:** Abstract + Conclusion (7-10 minutes)

Start at the top for the problem and context, skip to the conclusion for the decision and key rationale.

### Want to Apply This Framework?
**Read:** Abstract → Introduction → Methodology → Results → Conclusion (35-45 minutes)

Focus on the Methodology section to understand the decision process, then see how it was applied in Results.

### Deep Understanding?
**Read:** Full case study (60-90 minutes)

Read everything to understand the theoretical backing, limitations, and how to adapt the methodology to different contexts.

## What Makes These Different

**Not Opinion Pieces:** Every recommendation is backed by quantitative analysis against documented industry thresholds.

**Not Best Practices Lists:** These show the complete decision process, including what was considered and rejected, and why.

**Not Prescriptive:** The framework matters more than the specific decision. Your context will differ, and the methodology helps you make your own choice.

**Honest About Trade-offs:** No architecture choice is perfect. These case studies explicitly discuss what you gain and what you give up.

## Using These in Your Work

1. **Read the Abstract** - Does this match your situation?
2. **Check the context** - Similar scale, team size, constraints?
3. **Review the methodology** - Can you apply this framework?
4. **Adapt the framework** - Adjust weights and criteria for your needs
5. **Document your decision** - Use the same structure for your ADR

The goal isn't to copy decisions - it's to learn **how to make architecture decisions systematically** rather than based on what's trending on Twitter.
