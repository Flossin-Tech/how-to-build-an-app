# Spot the Job to Be Done - Mid-Depth

Practical techniques for uncovering what users actually need.

## Interview Actual Users, Not Stakeholders Who Think They Know

**Action:** Talk to 5-10 people who will actually use the thing, not their managers.

**Script:** "Walk me through the last time you [did the task]. What happened?"

**Measurable:** You've talked to actual users when you hear stories like "I tried X but it failed because..." not opinions like "users probably want..."

**Red flag:** If all your insights come from meetings with executives or product managers, you're building for the wrong person.

## Distinguish Between Stated Needs vs Observed Behavior

**Action:** Ask "Show me how you do this today" instead of "What features do you want?"

**What to watch:** Do they say "I always update the spreadsheet" but you see it's 3 months out of date? That's the real behavior.

**Measurable:** Record at least one contradiction per user interview ("they said X but actually do Y").

**Maxim:** "Watch what they do, not what they say they do."

## Identify the "Switching Moment"

**Action:** Ask: "What finally made you stop using [current solution] and try something else?"

**Look for:** Emotional language ("I was so frustrated..."), specific incidents ("After I lost the client...")

**Measurable:** You can complete this sentence: "Users switch when [specific trigger event] because [specific pain threshold crossed]"

**Example:** "Freelancers switch from separate calendars when they double-book a high-value client and lose the account"

## Map Competing Alternatives (Including "Do Nothing")

**Action:** List every way users currently solve this problem:
- Direct competitors (other apps)
- Workarounds (spreadsheets, paper, memory)
- "Do nothing" or live with the pain

**Measurable:** You have at least 3 alternatives documented with why each fails for your target users.

**Template:**
```
Alternative: Paper calendar
Why it fails: Can't sync across devices, easy to lose

Alternative: Do nothing
Why it fails: Cost of double-booking exceeds hassle of tracking
```

## Common Pitfall: Assuming Your Solution Is the Job

**Test:** Replace your solution with a completely different approach. Does the job statement still make sense?

- "Help freelancers avoid double-booking" ✅ (could use AI assistant, virtual receptionist, or calendar)
- "Help freelancers with a calendar app" ❌ (calendar is the solution, not the job)

**Measurable:** Your job statement contains zero technology/implementation details.
