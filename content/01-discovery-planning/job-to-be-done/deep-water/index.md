# Spot the Job to Be Done - Deep Water

Advanced frameworks for understanding and quantifying user needs.

## Jobs-to-be-Done Framework (Functional, Emotional, Social Dimensions)

**Concept:** Every job has three dimensions users are trying to satisfy simultaneously:
- **Functional:** The practical task ("schedule without conflicts")
- **Emotional:** How they want to feel ("confident I won't embarrass myself")
- **Social:** How they want to be perceived ("professional who respects clients' time")

**Action:** For your primary job, fill out all three dimensions:

```
Functional job: Consolidate availability across 5+ projects
Emotional job: Feel in control, reduce anxiety about mistakes
Social job: Appear organized and reliable to clients
```

**Why it matters:** Solutions that only solve functional jobs (e.g., "syncs calendars") lose to solutions that address emotional jobs (e.g., "sends confidence-building confirmations to clients").

**Real example:** Calendly wins not just by booking meetings (functional) but by making users look professional (social) and removing scheduling anxiety (emotional).

## Outcome-Driven Innovation Metrics

**Concept:** Users don't want features, they want outcomes measured as "minimize/maximize [metric]".

**Action:** Convert your job into measurable outcomes users want to improve:

```
Minimize: Time spent checking multiple calendars (currently 15 min/day)
Minimize: Risk of double-booking (currently 2-3 times/month)
Maximize: Confidence in availability accuracy (currently 60% confident)
```

**Measurable:** Survey users on satisfaction with each outcome (1-10 scale) and importance (1-10 scale).

**Prioritization formula:** Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
- Score >15 = underserved, high opportunity
- Score <10 = overserved, don't invest here

**Tool:** Create an opportunity landscape showing which outcomes to target.

## Jobs Mapping Across Customer Journey

**Concept:** The job changes as users move through stages: awareness → evaluation → purchase → onboarding → usage → renewal.

**Action:** Map what job exists at each stage:

```
Evaluation stage job: "Determine if this will actually prevent double-bookings
                       without disrupting my workflow"
Onboarding stage job: "Get my existing appointments imported without data
                       loss or duplicates"
Daily usage job: "Quickly check availability when client calls"
```

**Why it matters:** Marketing solves evaluation jobs, onboarding solves setup jobs, features solve usage jobs. Miss any stage and users churn.

**Measurable:** Track drop-off rates at each stage to find which jobs you're failing to address.

## Quantifying Underserved Outcomes vs Overserved

**Action:** For each outcome metric, plot where users are vs where they need to be:

```
Outcome: Minimize time to confirm availability
Current performance: 5 minutes (checking 3 calendars manually)
User satisfaction: 3/10 (very dissatisfied)
Adequate performance: 30 seconds
Overserved threshold: 5 seconds (diminishing returns)
```

**Strategy:** Focus on underserved outcomes (big satisfaction gap). Avoid overserving (adding features past "good enough").

**Real trap:** Adding calendar themes and animations when users just need faster conflict detection.

**Data source:** User interviews asking "At what point would this be good enough?" and "What would be overkill?"

## When B2B: Distinguish Between Economic Buyer's Job vs End User's Job

**Concept:** The person who pays is solving a different job than the person who uses.

```
Economic buyer (agency owner): "Reduce revenue loss from scheduling errors
                                 across my team"
End user (individual consultant): "Avoid embarrassing double-bookings with
                                   clients"
```

**Action:** Interview both personas separately. Map their jobs and success metrics:

```
Owner cares about: Team utilization rate, client retention, scalability
User cares about: Personal reputation, ease of daily use, not looking incompetent
```

**Critical insight:** You must solve BOTH jobs or you get situations where:
- Users love it but bosses won't pay (solves user job only)
- Bosses mandate it but users revolt (solves buyer job only)

**Measurable:** Can you articulate ROI for buyer AND demonstrate value for end user in first week?

**Example conflict:** Owner wants detailed time tracking (to bill clients accurately). Users see it as micromanagement overhead. Solution must thread this needle.
