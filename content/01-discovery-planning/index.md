# Phase 1: Discovery & Planning

Understanding what to build and why before writing any code.

This is where most projects either set themselves up for success or lock in failure. You can't build the right thing if you don't know what problem you're solving. Discovery and planning isn't about writing perfect requirements documents—it's about understanding the job your users are trying to do, identifying what could go wrong, and making sure you have the resources to actually build something useful.

The best code in the world doesn't matter if it solves the wrong problem. This phase helps you avoid that trap. You'll figure out what success looks like, who you're building for, what threats you need to defend against, and what's actually feasible with the time and people you have.

Think of this phase as drawing a map before a road trip. You don't need to plan every turn, but you need to know your destination, major waypoints, and which roads are washed out.

## Key Questions This Phase Answers

- What problem are we actually solving, and how do we know it's worth solving?
- Who are we building this for, and what does success look like for them?
- What could go wrong from a security, privacy, or safety perspective?
- Do we have the resources, skills, and time to actually build this?
- What's in scope for this version, and what can wait?

## What Comes Next

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, the users, the threats, and the constraints, you're ready to move into **[Design](../02-design/index.md)**—where you'll figure out how to actually build a solution that addresses what you discovered here.
