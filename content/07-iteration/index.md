# Phase 7: Iteration

Learning from outcomes and improving continuously.

Software is never done. Users' needs change. Security threats evolve. Technology improves. Your understanding of the problem deepens. Iteration is how you adapt to all of that instead of slowly becoming obsolete.

This isn't just about adding features. It's about learning from what happened—what worked, what didn't, what broke, what users loved, and what they ignored. It's about paying down technical debt before it compounds. It's about reviewing your security posture regularly, not just after a breach.

The teams that succeed long-term aren't the ones that got everything right the first time (no one does). They're the ones that learn faster, adapt better, and don't repeat the same mistakes. Iteration is how you get there.

## Key Questions This Phase Answers

- What do our metrics tell us about how users are actually using the system?
- What feedback are users giving us, and what does it really mean?
- What did we learn from the last sprint, deploy, or incident that we should change?
- Where is technical debt slowing us down, and what should we refactor?
- Has our security posture kept up with new threats and changes to the system?

## What Comes Next

Iteration feeds back into every other phase. What you learn here might send you back to **[Discovery & Planning](../01-discovery-planning/index.md)** to validate new assumptions, to **[Design](../02-design/index.md)** to refactor your architecture, or to **[Development](../03-development/index.md)** to pay down technical debt.

The cycle never ends. That's not a bug—it's how software works.
