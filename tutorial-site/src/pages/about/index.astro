        This is a non-linear guide to software development, organized using the Thermocline Principle.
        Content is structured in three depth levels, like ocean depth:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface (5-10 min):</strong> Essential information everyone needs</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-Depth (15-30 min):</strong> Practical guidance for competent practitioners</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Water (30-60+ min):</strong> Advanced topics for specialists</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Inspiration: Mortimer J. Adler's Levels of Reading</h2>

      <p>
        In <em>How to Read a Book</em> (1940), philosopher and educator Mortimer J. Adler identified four levels of reading comprehension:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Elementary:</strong> Basic literacy - understanding what the words say</li>
        <li><strong>Inspectional:</strong> Systematic skimming - getting the gist quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical:</strong> Thorough reading - understanding the book's arguments and structure</li>
        <li><strong>Syntopical:</strong> Comparative reading - synthesizing ideas across multiple books</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Adler's insight was that different reading situations call for different depths of engagement. You don't read a phone book the same way you read Aristotle.
        The reader should choose the appropriate level based on their goals and constraints.
      </p>

      <h3>Application to Software Development</h3>

      <p>
        This guide applies the same principle to technical documentation. Not every developer needs deep expertise in every topic.
        The key differences from traditional technical documentation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explicit layers:</strong> We make the depth levels visible and navigable, rather than forcing linear progression</li>
        <li><strong>Self-contained:</strong> Each depth level stands alone - you don't need to read Surface before Mid-Depth</li>
        <li><strong>Job-focused:</strong> Content is organized by what you're trying to accomplish, not abstract concepts</li>
        <li><strong>Escape hatches:</strong> You can dive deep on what matters to your project and stay shallow on everything else</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Just as Adler recognized that reading "War and Peace" requires different effort than reading a newspaper,
        we recognize that securing a healthcare application requires different depth than building a personal blog.
        The Thermocline Principle lets you choose your depth deliberately rather than forcing everyone into the deep end.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>

      <p>This guide is designed for non-linear access. You can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Browse by Phase:</strong> Follow the 7 development lifecycle phases in order</li>
        <li><strong>Follow a Learning Path:</strong> Guided journeys for different personas and goals</li>
        <li><strong>Jump to Topics:</strong> Go directly to what you need, when you need it</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The 7 Development Phases</h2>

      <ol>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#01-discovery-planning')}>Discovery & Planning</a></li>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#02-design')}>Design</a></li>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#03-development')}>Development</a></li>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#04-testing')}>Testing</a></li>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#05-deployment')}>Deployment</a></li>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#06-operations')}>Operations</a></li>
        <li><a href={joinPath('/phases/#07-iteration')}>Iteration</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Each section is self-contained. Read surface layer, ship MVP, come back later for mid-depth.
        The YOLO dev doesn't need DREAD scoring for threat modeling - they need "List 3 things an attacker could do and how to prevent them."
