  "description": {
    "short": "Secure dependencies, build tools, and CI/CD pipelines",
    "medium": "Review dependencies before installing, scan for vulnerabilities with SCA tools, generate SBOMs, use lock files, verify signatures, and protect your build pipeline from compromise",
    "full": "Supply chain security protects the dependencies, build tools, container images, CI/CD pipelines, and third-party components your application relies on. This covers dependency scanning (SCA), Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), lock files, license compliance, typosquatting defense, container security, code signing, SLSA framework, private registries, and responding to supply chain compromises like SolarWinds or Log4Shell."
  },

  "why_it_matters": [
    "High-profile attacks target the supply chain (SolarWinds, Log4j, event-stream)",
    "Dependencies can contain malware or vulnerabilities",
    "Transitive dependencies create hidden risk",
    "Compromised build pipelines affect all downstream users",
    "Compliance increasingly requires SBOM and provenance"
  ],

      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "objectives": [
        "Understand that dependencies are attack vectors",
        "Use dependency scanning tools (Dependabot, Snyk, npm audit)",
        "Review packages before installing them"
      ],
      "key_takeaways": [
        "Don't blindly install packages - review them first",
        "Use lock files (package-lock.json, Pipfile.lock, go.sum)",
        "Enable automated vulnerability scanning",
        "Keep dependencies updated regularly"

        "Set up comprehensive dependency scanning in CI/CD",
        "Defend against typosquatting and malicious packages",
        "Scan container images for vulnerabilities"
      ],
      "key_takeaways": [
        "SBOM provides visibility into all components",
        "Direct and transitive dependencies both pose risk",
        "Lock files ensure reproducible builds",

      "key_takeaways": [
        "SLSA levels provide measurable supply chain security maturity",
        "Code signing and provenance prevent tampering",
        "Private registries with mirroring reduce external dependency risk",
