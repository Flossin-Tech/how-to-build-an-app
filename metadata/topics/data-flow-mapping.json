    "short": "Understand where data comes from, what happens to it, and where it goes",
    "medium": "Map how data flows through your system to understand entry points, transformations, storage locations, and exit points - essential for security, compliance, and debugging",
    "full": "Data flow mapping visualizes the journey of data through your application - from user input to database to third-party services to backups. This understanding is critical for security (identifying attack surfaces), compliance (GDPR deletion requests, HIPAA audits), debugging (tracing data bugs), and architecture decisions. Learn to map trust boundaries, identify sensitive data flows, and create documentation that serves both technical and compliance needs."
