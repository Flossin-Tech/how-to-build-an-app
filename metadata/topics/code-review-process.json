    "short": "Catch bugs and share knowledge through effective code review",
    "medium": "Establish review workflows, learn what to look for, give and receive constructive feedback, and build a review culture that improves code quality without killing velocity",
    "full": "Code review is a quality gate where another developer examines code changes before they're merged. This covers pull request best practices, what to look for (correctness, design, security, performance, tests), giving and receiving effective feedback, automated checks, review metrics, and building psychological safety in code review culture. Good reviews catch bugs, share knowledge, and maintain standards."

    "Shares knowledge across the team",
    "Maintains code quality and consistency",
