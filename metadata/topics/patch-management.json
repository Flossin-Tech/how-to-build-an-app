    "short": "Keep systems secure by managing vulnerability patches effectively",
    "medium": "Systematic approach to applying security patches and updates to protect against vulnerabilities, balancing security urgency with operational stability",
    "full": "Patch management is how you close security holes before attackers walk through them. With 130+ vulnerabilities published daily but only 4% actively exploited, the challenge is knowing what to patch when. Learn risk-based prioritization using CISA KEV catalog and SSVC framework, patch testing strategies that balance speed with stability, and compensating controls for when patches aren't immediately available."
