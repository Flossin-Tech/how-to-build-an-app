    "short": "Identify and prioritize security threats before building",
    "medium": "Systematic approach to identifying, quantifying, and addressing security threats during the planning phase - cheaper to fix in design than production",
    "full": "Threat modeling is a structured process for identifying potential security threats, understanding their likelihood and impact, and planning mitigations before writing code. Using frameworks like STRIDE, you can systematically think about what could go wrong and design defenses accordingly. This prevents building vulnerable systems and is far cheaper than fixing security issues in production."

  "why_it_matters": [
    "Catches security issues before they're built into the system",
    "Cheaper to fix vulnerabilities in design than production (10-100x cost difference)",
    "Helps prioritize security work based on actual risk",
    "Creates shared security understanding across team",
    "Required by most compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)"
