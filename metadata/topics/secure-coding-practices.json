  "description": {
    "short": "Prevent vulnerabilities through secure code",
    "medium": "Master OWASP Top 10 defenses, input validation, output encoding, authentication/authorization, injection prevention, XSS/CSRF protection, and cryptography to build secure applications from the ground up",
    "full": "Secure coding prevents vulnerabilities at the source code level. This covers the OWASP Top 10 (injection, broken access control, cryptographic failures, XSS, etc.), input validation and sanitization, output encoding, authentication and authorization patterns, parameterized queries, error handling that doesn't leak information, dependency security, and integrating security testing (SAST/DAST) into development workflows."
  },

  "why_it_matters": [
    "Security vulnerabilities lead to data breaches and regulatory penalties",
    "It's far cheaper to prevent vulnerabilities than fix them in production",
    "User trust depends on protecting their data",
    "Compliance requires secure coding (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)",
    "Attackers actively scan for common vulnerabilities"
  ],

        "Avoid the most critical vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)",

        "Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation"
      ],
      "key_takeaways": [
        "Never trust user input - validate and sanitize everything",
        "Use prepared statements for database queries",
        "Encode output to prevent XSS",

      "key_takeaways": [
        "Every OWASP Top 10 item has code-level defenses",
        "Allowlist validation is safer than blocklist",
